# 🛍️ Google Merch Shop Performance Dashboard

This project analyzes the performance of the **Google Merchandise Store**, using **GA4 (Google Analytics 4)** and **Looker Studio**, with the goal of creating a comprehensive dashboard that can be easily shared internally across teams at Google.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. **Summarize the business performance** of the Google Merch Store in a single, user-friendly dashboard.
2. **Identify key opportunities** for optimization through data insights and propose actionable improvements.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** – for collecting and analyzing user behavior and e-commerce data.
- **Looker Studio** – for building a clear, visual dashboard accessible across departments.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard includes a wide range of KPIs and visualizations covering:

- **User Demographics**: Age, gender, location
- **Acquisition Channels**: Breakdown of how users are arriving (organic, paid, referral, direct, etc.)
- **Website Engagement**: Sessions, time spent on site, bounce rates, and pageviews
- **Event Tracking**: Key user interactions and conversions
- **Sales Insights**:
  - Revenue trends over time
  - Most sold products
  - Profitability metrics
- **Campaign & Promotion Performance**: Efficiency of paid campaigns and promotional efforts
- **Conversion Funnel**: From product view to cart to checkout
- **Device & Platform Analysis**: Desktop vs mobile behavior and purchase patterns

---

## 🔍 Key Findings & Opportunities

### 1. Low Impact from Paid Campaigns
- **Insight**: Paid ads drive only 3% of total traffic.
- **Suggestion**: Reassess targeting and ad creative; consider A/B testing new segments or formats.

### 2. June Drop in Key Metrics
- **Insight**: June saw a sharp decline in new users, session duration, purchases, and average order value.
- **Suggestion**: Investigate site or campaign changes in that period; possibly a UX or technical issue.

### 3. High Product Sales without Promotion
- **Insight**: A spike in sales of the *Google Pen White* in March occurred without any discounts.
- **Suggestion**: Analyze traffic sources or referral influence; explore replicating this effect on similar products.

3. Share the dashboard internally to align teams on data-driven decisions.

## 💡 Next Steps
